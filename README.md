# Demon_in_the_Machine
This is an implementation of Whitelam's paper, "Demon in the Machine: Learning to Extract Work and Absorb Entropy from Fluctuating Nanosystems" in python. [1]
You can see his original code written in C from the following link.

The paper reports on the use of Monte Carlo and genetic algorithms to train neural networks for feedback control in fluctuating nanosystems.


One demonstration of this paper that astonished me was the Magnetization Reversal with Negative Entropy Production. The study demonstrates that magnetization reversal in the Ising model can be achieved with negative entropy production, implying that work can be extracted from the thermal bath using optimally learned trajectories.
